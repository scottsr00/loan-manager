This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Description

This application is a loan management system that allows users to 12manage their loans efficiently. Users can view, add, and edit loan details, making it easier to keep track of their financial commitments.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vercel**: The platform for deploying Next.js applications.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
